# simple-json-manipulator
<br>
This a simple site HTML5 / CSS / JS that loads simple json data groups into a select tool, and each group's values to manipulate using sliders.<br>
<br>
The gui is data driven by script.js (see details in comments), and updates can be saved to a file.<br>
The biggest efficiency is made by using the json key names as slider id's<br>

If you're new to this, first install an http server like https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server<br>
Then...<br>
1. Open the unzipped repository folder in Visual Studio Code<br>
2. Open a new Terminal and type "http-server" without quotes, Enter<br>
3. I recommend opening localhost://8080 in Chrome, then open Developer Tools which allows a hard refresh (control-refresh) as you make code updates
